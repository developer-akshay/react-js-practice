    // Implement a custom hook for debouncing an input value.

// React Hooks Deep Dive

    // Implement a custom hook for handling localStorage with state sync.

    // Write a usePrevious hook that returns the previous state value.

    // Implement a useOnClickOutside custom hook to detect clicks outside a given component.

    // Create a useInterval hook that works like setInterval but is cleared on component unmount.

// State Management Challenges

    // Build a complex state reducer using useReducer for a shopping cart with add, remove, update item quantity actions.

    // Implement a global state management solution using React Context API from scratch.

    // Create a todo app with undo/redo functionality using useReducer.

    // Implement lazy loading of components using React.lazy and Suspense.

    // Create a component that prevents unnecessary re-renders using React.memo.

    // Implement a debounced search input component that does not fire unnecessary API calls.

    // Create a mechanism to split a large bundle into smaller chunks with dynamic import().

    // Implement a function to compare deeply nested props and prevent re-render unless data changed.

    // Optimize image rendering by using low-quality placeholders before full image loads.

    // Write a function that tracks and logs render time of a component.

    // Build a PureComponent equivalent using function components and memo.

// Advanced Component Communication

    // Implement parent-child communication via context and prop drilling simultaneously.

    // Create a dynamic component loader that fetches component code from an API at runtime.

    // Build a messaging system between two sibling components using custom hooks.

    // Implement a subscription-based event emitter system in React for cross-component communication.

    // Create a publish-subscribe mechanism with Context API.

    // Build a portal-based modal component that supports multiple open modals.

    // Implement a dynamic tab system where new tabs are added at runtime, and state is maintained.

    // Write a component that synchronizes state with URL query parameters.

    // Create a system where child components notify the parent when their internal state changes.

    // Implement a component that listens to browser navigation (back/forward) events and syncs state.

// Testing & Debugging

    // Write a unit test for a component that fetches data using Jest and React Testing Library.

    // Implement snapshot testing for a complex form component.

    // Build a custom hook with unit tests that validates form fields asynchronously.

    // Create a test that mocks API calls and verifies state updates accordingly.

    // Implement error boundary tests that confirm fallback UI appears on error.

    // Write a test to verify that a memoized component does not re-render unnecessarily.

    // Build a test for a component that should call a provided callback prop only once on mount.

    // Create a test for a component that cancels ongoing async requests when unmounted.

    // Write a test to simulate window resize events and verify hook response.

    // Implement a performance test that checks render time of a heavy component.

// Integration with External Systems
