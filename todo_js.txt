1 Reverse a String (basic foundation)
2 Check if a String is a Palindrome (two-pointer / reversal logic
3 Remove Duplicates from a String (set / hashing use)
4 Find the First Non-Repeating Character (hashmap pattern)
5 Check if Two Strings are Anagrams (sorting / frequency counting)
6 Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (sliding window)
7 Replace Spaces with %20 (URL Encoding) (practical interview classic)
8 Compress a String - Run-Length Encoding (two-pointer / counting pattern)
9 Find the Longest Palindromic Substring (expand around center / DP)
10 Find the Longest Common Prefix (interview classic)
11 Imagine you need to process 100 items with an asynchronous function, where each item is independent.you can only run 10 async calls in parallel, Once those 10 finish, you trigger the next batch of 10, and repeat the cycle until all 100 items are processed. How would you implement this in JavaScript?, You also need to log each batch as it starts/finishes and collect all results in order.
12 Design a custom debounce polyfill function utilizing call, apply, and bind methods, along with real-world scenarios for choosing between call, apply, or bind.
